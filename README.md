# Web-Scraping
This project is a Python-based web scraping script that extracts information about TV series from IMDb and stores it in a CSV file. It utilizes the requests library to make HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing. The scraped data includes series names, release years, ratings, and genres.
